## Why did you quit your last job?

So I‘ve been at this last company for over 6 years. But I kind of felt like I'd learnerd as much as I posibly could. So they treated me great. But I'm kind of looking for a new Challenge right now. I want to learn more and gain some more experience and that's why I'm applying for this job today.

## 遇到不会回答的问题怎么办？

That's a great question. Can you give me a few moment to think about it?
